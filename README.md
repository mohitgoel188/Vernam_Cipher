# Vernam_Cipher

Vernam Cipher is well known technique in cryptography, used for producing the so called unbreakable encrypted code. The details of this technique can be found [here](http://www.pro-technix.com/information/crypto/pages/vernam_base.html#truernd).  
This python implementation is not inherently unbreakable as randomness used here is only pseudo-random in nature, which means if a true random generator is used this implementaion will produce unbreakabe code indeed.  
The message.txt file should contain the desired message to be encrypted.  
**NOTE** The message should contain hyphen ('-') in place of spaces.   

## Getting Started

The [vernamCypher.py](https://github.com/mohitgoel188/Vernam-Cipher/blob/master/vernamCipher.py) file is the main file which contains all relevant code.   
  
### Prerequisites

Python 3.6.x is required.

### Installing

Python 3 can be found at [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
